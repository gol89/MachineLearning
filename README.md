# MachineLearning Projects 

## California Housing 
The Dataset contains district wise information like the latitude, longitude, median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, 
population, households, median income, ocean proximity (categorical data) and we try to predict the median house value.
Exploratory data analysis has been done after dividing the dataset into Train and test set.
New features like the rooms per household, population per household and bedrooms per rooms have been created.
Numeric data pipeline and Full data pipeline have been created using Pipeline and ColumnTransformer.
Various models (LinearRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest and ANN) are trained to predict the median house value.
